NAME

    Geo::OSM::Overpass::Plugin::FetchTrafficSignals - Plugin for
    Geo::OSM::Overpass to fetch bus stop data in given area

VERSION

    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS

    This is a plugin for Geo::OSM::Overpass, which is a module to fetch
    data from the OpenStreetMap Project using Overpass API. It fetches data
    about bus stops within a geographical area defined by a bounding box.
    In order to use this plugin, first create a Geo::BoundingBox object for
    the bounding box enclosing the area. Secondly, create a
    Geo::OSM::Overpass object to do the communication with the Overpass API
    server. Thirdly, create the plugin object and run its gorun() method.

        use Geo::BoundingBox;
        use Geo::OSM::Overpass;
        use Geo::OSM::Overpass::Plugin::FetchTrafficSignals;
    
        my $bbox = Geo::BoundingBox->new();
        # a bounding box bounded by (bottom-left-corner, top-right-corner) as LAT,LON
        $bbox->bounded_by(35.175699, 33.374037, 35.176120, 33.374745);
        my $eng = Geo::OSM::Overpass->new();
        die unless defined $eng;
        $eng->bbox($bbox) or die;
        my $plug = Geo::OSM::Overpass::Plugin::FetchTrafficSignals->new({
            'engine' => $eng
        });
        die unless defined $plug;
        $plug->gorun() or die;
        # print results, but it's a reference!
        print "Results: ".${$eng->last_query_result()}."\n";
        # prints:
        # <?xml version="1.0"?>

SUBROUTINES/METHODS

 new({'engine' => $eng})

    Constructor. A hashref of parameters contains the only required
    parameter which is an already created Geo::OSM::Overpass object. If in
    your plugin have no use for this, then call it like
    new({'engine'=undef})>

 gorun()

    It will execute the query using the specified Geo::OSM::Overpass object
    (aka the engine) specified in the constructor.

    It will return 1 on success or undef on failure.

    The result of the query can be accessed using ```print "Results:
    ".${eng->last_query_result()}."\n";```
